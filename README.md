Doc2U - Healthcare Platform 

Backend (Microservices Architecture)

This repository contains the backend services for a secure, scalable Healthcare Appointment Platform built using a microservices architecture.
The system includes authentication, doctor management, patient appointments, prescription handling, real-time notifications, and secure video consultations.

Architecture Overview

The backend is composed of multiple independent microservices, all connected through an API Gateway.
Each service has its own database and isolated business logic.

🧩 Microservices Included
Service	Responsibility

API Gateway         -	Routes client requests to appropriate microservices
UserAuthService     -	User authentication, JWT, cookies, roles
DoctorService       -	Doctor profiles, availability slots, prescriptions
PatientService      -	Patient profiles, appointments, doctor selection
NotificationService -	Email notifications (registration, bookings, etc.)
VideoService	      - Jitsi-based secure video meeting management

🏗️ Technology Stack

1. .NET 7 / .NET 8 Web API

2. Entity Framework Core

3. SQL Server

4. JWT Authentication (HttpOnly Cookies)

5. Microservices Architecture

6. REST API

7. Jitsi Meet for Video Calls

8. Email Provider (SMTP / SendGrid / etc.)

9. Grpc for service to service communication (notification service)

10. HttpClient for service to service communication

========
🔐 1. UserAuthService
Handles all authentication and authorization workflows.
========
Features

* User Registration & Login

* Generates JWT Token

* JWT is sent to frontend as a HttpOnly cookie

* Role-based Access Control (doctor/patient/admin)

* Profile Management

========
🧑‍⚕️ 2. DoctorService
Manages doctor data and medical operations.
========

Features

* Create and manage doctor availability slots

* Doctor can prescribe medicines to patients

* Fetch appointments for a doctor

* Secure data handled using JWT validation

* Create a Meeting room using and allow patient to join

========

* Generates secure access token

* Backend validates token → redirects user to correct meeting

* Prevents unauthorized meeting access

* Guarantees doctor-only room access and patient-only room entry

========
-- Final Flow --
========

* Appointment created → VideoService stores meeting link

* Patient clicks “Join Meeting”

* Frontend sends request to backend
